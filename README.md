# Visualization-of-the-Mandelbrotmenge
Good little project for beginners. Simplified code that draws the Mandelbrotmenge. Graphical framework in use is tkinter.
Zooming inside is not possible in this implementation.

The calculation for the iteration is just a simple solution. For a better performance, and maybe a zooming functionality, these have to become modified.
